## How to Use

1. Unzip this file
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. For best results, serve the files with a local server:
   ```
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

## Component Viewer

If components were extracted, you can view them by opening `components/index.html`

## Notes

- Some assets might not load correctly due to cross-origin restrictions
- External resources and APIs may not work without proper configuration
- JavaScript functionality might be limited without a proper backend

## Handling Modern Frameworks

This extraction has been optimized to handle the following frameworks:
- React and Next.js: Script chunks and module loading
- Angular: Component structure and scripts
- Tailwind CSS: Utility classes and structure
